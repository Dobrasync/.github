### Open Source

Dobrasync provides access to its source code, allowing anyone to inspect and modify it. This transparency promotes collaborative development, enhances security through community reviews, and enables customization to meet specific needs.

### Self Hostable

Dobrasync can be installed and run on your own servers or infrastructure. This offers full control over data management, security configurations, and customization options, eliminating dependency on third-party service providers.

### File Versioning

Dobrasync tracks versions and stores multiple versions of files over time. This feature allows users to view the history of changes, revert to previous versions if necessary, and maintain a comprehensive record of modifications for accountability and recovery purposes.

### End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

End-to-end encryption, or E2EE, ensures that data can only be encrypted and decrypted on the sender's device. This means that even if the data is intercepted during transmission or accessed on servers, it remains unreadable to unauthorized parties, thereby enhancing privacy and security.

### Multi-user Support

Dobrasync allows the regirations of multiple users. Each user can create their own seperate libraries.

### Web Interface

Dobrasync provides a web interface users can use to interact with the application without needing to install dedicated software. This accessibility makes it easier to use the application from various devices and locations, streamlining user experience and reducing setup barriers.

### Cross Platform

Dedicated native applications for each major platform (Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS).

It is planned for Dobrasync to offer native applications for Linux, Windows, and Android. MacOS and iOS support are not planned.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

Peer-to-peer architecture enables direct communication and resource sharing between users' devices without relying on a central server. This decentralization can improve performance, reduce latency, and enhance privacy, as data is exchanged directly between peers. 

Dobrasync does not offer peer-to-peer communication at this moment.
