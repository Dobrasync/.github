## About

Dobrasync is a self-hosted, centralized file synchronization solution that allows you to sync files across multiple devices, while offering additional features like multi-user support.


## Why use Dobrasync

There are a lot of file sync projects out there (Dropbox, Google Drive, Onedrive, ...). Most of these however are either not not self hostable or open source. 

When it comes to (free and) open source software, Syncthing and Seafile are the most popular open source programs. **In most cases it is probably best to use one of these two**. But there are still cases where neither of them are sufficient:

- Syncthing does not offer multi-user support
- Seafile does not offer 2-way-sync for other platforms except Linux and Windows.

If these two restrictions also happen to affect you, you might want to give Dobrasync a try.
